# Snacklish
Snacklish is a small application that can convert text on-demand to the Snacklish language.

## Example
### Before:
```
Bob Page: Your appointment to FEMA should be finalized within the week. I've already discussed the
          matter with the Senator.
Walton Simons: I take it he was agreeable?
Page: He didn't really have a choice.
Simons: Has he been infected?
Page: Ah yes, most certainly. When I mentioned we could put him on the priority list for the Ambrosia
      vaccine, he was so willing it was almost pathetic.
Simons: This plague — the rioting is intensifying to the point where we may not be able to contain it.
Page: Why contain it? Let it spill over into the schools and churches. Let the bodies pile up in the
      streets. In the end, they'll beg us to save them.
```

### After:
```

```

## How to Use
- Install the application
- Highlight some text
- In the cursor overflow, tap the three dots and then "To Snacklish"

If the selected text was readonly (such as text in a web article) the Snacklish translation will get copied to your clipboard.
If the selected text was in an editable input field, the entire input will be converted to Snacklish.
